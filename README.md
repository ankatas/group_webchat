# group_webchat

A simple application that allows multiple users to engage in chat. Supports some additional functionalities.

Java web group chat is able to support connections from multiple clients, and the communication happens in the terminal. You can configure the host, port, and nickname on entry.

It's hosted on a local machine, both client and the server implement concurrent programming, and all in all, this group chat was just a fun little project to make during my extensive studies.
